@Code-ie8ub,hope mic will be better in 2025
@bobler4193,Wonderful video!
@JijunZou,Great video!
@JinhaoPan-np7zy,thanks
@TheCosmic_Chronicles,Nicely Explained!
@Justme-religiousgirl,"You already taught this in 2020, why again? What's the difference?"
@patrickmultimedia,somethings gotta be done about the mic with the questions its absolutely horrible sound!!!
@patrickmultimedia,holy smokes!
@isatousarr7044,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models that have revolutionized computer vision and image processing. Inspired by the structure of the visual cortex, CNNs are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images, making them exceptionally effective at tasks like image classification, object detection, facial recognition, and medical image analysis.

CNNs operate by applying convolutional layers to input data, where small filters (or kernels) slide over the data to detect local patterns like edges, textures, and shapes. These patterns are then combined in deeper layers to recognize more complex structures. Pooling layers are used to reduce the spatial dimensions, making the model more computationally efficient while preserving important features. The final layers often consist of fully connected layers that interpret the features and make predictions.

The power of CNNs lies in their ability to learn features directly from raw data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. This has led to significant breakthroughs in fields ranging from autonomous driving, where CNNs are used to detect objects on the road, to healthcare, where they assist in analyzing medical scans like MRIs and X-rays to detect abnormalities like tumors.

However, CNNs are not without challenges. They require large amounts of labeled data and significant computational resources to train effectively. Overfitting can also be a problem when the model becomes too specialized to the training data. Despite these limitations, CNNs continue to be one of the most powerful tools in machine learning, with ongoing research focused on improving their efficiency, generalization, and interpretability for even broader applications."
@wuyanfeng42,"OMG, it's so intuitive !🤩"
@noushadarakkal5179,"Thanks for this great lecture series. 
However the audio is muffled at some points"

@albertmills9365,"It's weird that he uses Boston Dynamics robots in his first slides, since boston dynamics has gone on record saying they don't use AI."
@johnpuopolo4413,"Great series! Thanks for making the concepts approachable. These lectures are at a perfect level for understanding key concepts and for having the vocabulary and foundation for understanding other available materials. I especially found Ava's overview of Transformers and how the Q, K, and V matrices relate an ""a ha"" moment! Thank you, all."
@fideslegoale9611,Thank you for courses we are learning lot
@mahmoudjafari-tk6ry,Dear Amini.was good trech too especially navigation too
@darylltempesta,I love you but the Keller Paradox points to overlooked emergence.
@zhspartan9993,Thanks for the lecture
@sudhirkothari,fantastic ! thank you for the lectures
@Mantra-x1d,Testing
@leesiheon8013,Love the lecture!
@ajaywanekar9136,Very nice Explanation
@jteichma,Great courses thanks!❤
@jsherborne92,"Great content, but audio sounds like it was recorded with a toaster"
@ajayrathore7045,The lecture is awesome but the quality of audio is very poor.
@marlhex6280,"Hello Alex, please enlighten the peasants with a juicy time series episode? If you had been my teacher since I was a kid, I would be a different person today. Thank you for this, grateful today and in the future."
@sansdieutechstreetwear,Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
@bytegraftkids,I don't even need to be in MIT to learn from them! Outstanding and clear delivery of difficult concepts.Thank you.

@vijaykumars1771,"Thank you, i have one doubt here, at 15:30 you said 10 k neurons in hidden layer for processing 10k  parameters, so resultant would be 10k^2 parameters. My doubt is why we need 10 k neurons at any layer. we can decide the number of layers right?"
@meshkatuddinahammed,I have a confusion about the Lab 2 Part 2 ( facial Detection with CNN). It has been claimed that in the CelebA dataset most faces are of light skinned females. But the model ultimately gives lower accuracy for this category of faces compared to other three categories. Why is that?
@PerceptronsAI,I wanted to extend my sincere thanks for the wonderful lecture you delivered on Deep Learning.

@tmcgraw,right?
@ghaithal-refai4550,"Thank you very much, it is a great lecture. I hope that you develop the lectures over the years as it seems to be the same contents. topics like pretrained models and knowledge transfer, YOLO might be good to be added to CNN"
@DreamBuilders-rq6km,Thanks for sharing this knowledge. Be blessed
@husseinekeita8909,Thank you for sharing quality content like this for free for several years
@htoorutube,"Software Lab 1 still not made available, when will that happen?"
@jorgeguiragossian8488,Have any of the labs been published yet?
@woodworkingaspirations1720,Waiting patiently
@samiragh63,Cant wait...
@shahriarahmadfahim6457,But the lab between Lecture 2 and 3 is still not published in the website?
@genkideska4486,Waiting ..
